    "### Background/Overview\n",
    "As an NBA fan and a Computer Science student, I have been fascinated by the statistics that we can gather and observe around the NBA.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the NBA 2020-2021 season is nearing its end, we are close to seeing which NBA teams will reach the finals and get the ring. Two teams from the eastern and western conference will battle it out and become NBA champions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the Western conference already has its finalists: the Phoenix Suns led by Future NBA Hall of Famer Chris Paul and Rising NBA star Devin Booker, and the Los Angeles Clippers led by NBA Superstars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. On the other hand, the Eastern Conference semifinals has not yet ended. With Brooklyn Nets tied with Milwaukee Bucks at 3-3 and the Philadelphia 76ers tied with Atlanta Hawks at 3-3 as well. We are yet to see who will face each other in the Eastern conference finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This machine learning project will predict the outcome between which of these teams will reach the Finals and the Championship."

This can be applied to both a team's offense and defense. More at [NBAstuffer](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/four-factors/)."
